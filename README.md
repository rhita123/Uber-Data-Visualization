# Uber Data Visualization Project – EFREI BIA 2025

This notebook explores **Uber trip data** through data analysis and visualization techniques, as part of the **Data Visualization module** at EFREI Paris (Business Intelligence & Analytics – 2025).

The goal of this project is to analyze user behavior, trip frequency, and time-based patterns to extract meaningful insights about Uber ride demand in a major city.

##  Objectives

- Explore and clean Uber trip data  
- Analyze trends in trip frequency across **days, hours, and months**  
- Visualize the most active **pickup locations and times**  
- Identify **peak hours** and **usage patterns**  
- Create clear and insightful visualizations for decision-making

## Main Visualizations

The notebook includes the following analyses:

1. **Data Overview and Cleaning**  
   → Inspection of dataset, missing values, and structure.

2. **Temporal Analysis**  
   → Number of trips per day, month, and hour.  
   → Detection of rush hours and busy periods.

3. **Pickup Frequency Analysis**  
   → Visualizing top pickup locations.  
   → Heatmaps of trip density by time and location.

4. **Weekly and Monthly Trends**  
   → Comparing weekday vs weekend ride volumes.  
   → Seasonal changes in ride frequency.

5. **Correlation Insights**  
   → Exploring relationships between variables (time, location, frequency).
